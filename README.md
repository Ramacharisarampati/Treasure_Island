Created to solve a puzzle using nested if statements in Py.
The game begins by asking the player: "You're at a crossroad. Do you want to go left or right?" The player must type their choice. If they choose left, the game proceeds to a lake scenario where they decide to wait for a boat or swim across. Choosing to wait leads to a final choice among three doors: red, yellow, or blue. Depending on the door selected, the player either wins or encounters a Game Over.
